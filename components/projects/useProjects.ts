    goal: "Understanding what calls the Inner Harbor home is an important step in making the Harbor a better place for everybody. We can get a deeper sense of the Inner Harborâ€™s health over time by sampling and analyzing it at regular intervals. we use the microscope and advanced DNA analysis to identify what organisms are present. We can use this data to find ways to affect positive changes on the Harbor and use this natural resource in sustainable ways.We want to know if the community of aquatic animals varies in locations with different watersheds and shorelines, such as areas of suburban runoff, industrial legacy pollutants, or restoration activities. The project is therefore expanding and sampling 6 sites around the Chesapeake Bay.",

    goal: "make real cheese without using any animals!\nReal Vegan Cheese is a not a cheese substitute! It all starts with regular old baker's yeast. Through synthetic biology, we engineer our yeast to become milk-protein factories. Our milk proteins are then combined with water and vegan oil to make Vegan Milk which is ultimately converted into Real Vegan Cheese through standard cheese-making processes - just like cheese made from cow or goat milk! In principle, we can make cheese from any animal for which we have a genome sequence - even something as strange as Narwhal whales.",

M. polymorpha has traits that make it ideal for bioengineering. Its small size and fast lifecycle, allows experiments to be carried out quickly and easily. As group members learn to work with this plant, we will begin building novel circuits and expressing interesting proteins such as antibodies, cytochromes, and inteins.",
